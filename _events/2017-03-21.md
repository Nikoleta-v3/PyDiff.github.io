# Nothing but lightning talks!

We have a collection of lightning talks scheduled for this meetup but also
welcome any/all talks on the day:

- Form a queue;
- Use the (strict) five minute limit to speak about anything that you feel might
  be of interest to the crowd (it doesn't actually have to be Python related).

Lightning talks are a regular occurrence at PyCons and are often the highlight!

There's a playlist of all the Lightning talks below, or head over to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCcALWUCcmAvarMeYv5qlOg) to view the talks individually:
