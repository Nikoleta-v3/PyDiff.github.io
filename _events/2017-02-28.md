The Cardiff University [Phoenix
Project](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project/about-us) is a partnership
with the University of Namibia. One of the projects is the organisation of an
annual Python conference in Windhoek (the capital). This talk will describe
the 3 conferences that have taken place and reflect on plans for the future of
Python in Namibia.
