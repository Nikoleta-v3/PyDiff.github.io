With [2017 being the year of AI](http://www.cio.com/article/3152803/artificial-intelligence/2017-will-be-big-year-for-ai-thanks-to-tech-giants.html)
and smart assistants, it was about time that Axelrod broke out of its prison that was the terminal.  In this talk I
will tell you how AWS, a guy called [John Wheeler](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask) and twitter convinced me
to make not one but two Axelrod related skills for the Amazon Echo.  

Becuase lets face it physically typing out 'C' or 'D' is so 2016.

As usual in these meetups there will be the oppertunity for some lightning talks at the end:

- Form a queue;
- Use the (strict) five minute limit to speak about anything that you feel might
be of interest to the crowd (it doesn't actually have to be Python related).

Lightning talks are a regular occurrence at PyCons and are often the highlight!
